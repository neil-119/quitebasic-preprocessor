# quitebasic-preprocessor
A QB preprocessor to add support for named subroutines and variables, full color image rendering, and VS output linking. Also a Super Mario mechanics implementation written with the aid of the preprocessor. Outputs 100% BASIC code (requirements of the ng-hackathon this year). Just open the solution and hit debug.
